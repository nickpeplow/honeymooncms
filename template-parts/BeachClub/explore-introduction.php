    <p><strong>Bali boasts some of the best Beach Clubs in the world. Most of them can be found facing the Indian Ocean just north of Baliâ€™s airport, near the towns of <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="/regions/seminyak-honeymoon/">Seminyak</a> and <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="/regions/canggu-honeymoon/">Canggu</a>. Another region with fancy ocean-front Day Clubs is <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="/regions/uluwatu-honeymoon/">Uluwatu</a>, however often they are on a cliff, so while you can view the ocean, its hard to reach the actual beach!</strong></p>

    <p>We believe a visit to a Beach Club is a <em>must-do</em> during any <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="/">Bali honeymoon</a> or vacation as a couple. We have been living in Bali for over 6 years and have visited many, sometimes together as a couple and sometimes with friends. Below are our favorites.</p>
