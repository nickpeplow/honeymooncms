          Day Trips: a convenient way to see Bali!
      </h2>
      <p class="my-3">
          <strong>Bali is a large island. Depending on where you stay, you can find beaches, cliffs, rice fields, volcanoes, temples, lakes, hot springs or waterfalls in your proximity. The many options can be overwhelming. By booking guided tours in Bali, you will be able to see different regions across the island without switching accommodation all the time.</strong>
      </p>
      <h2 id="starting-point-your-hotel" class="mb-3 mt-7">
          Starting point: your hotel!
      </h2>
      <p class="my-3">
        <p>Most tourists stay in the South of Bali, relatively close to the airport. The Bali tours below can pick you up in your hotel in <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="/regions/canggu-honeymoon/">Canggu</a>, <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="/regions/seminyak-honeymoon/">Seminyak</a>, <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="/regions/nusa-dua-honeymoon/">Nusa Dua</a> or <a href="/regions/ubud-honeymoon/">Ubud</a> and drop you back home at the end of the day. Some of the options listed below can start from <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="/regions/uluwatu-honeymoon/">Uluwatu</a> as well, but Uluwatu is further south, resulting in a longer drive to most nature sights in North and Central Bali.</p>

        <p><strong>Private Tour or Group Tour:</strong> Weâ€™ve listed both group tours and private day trips below. On your honeymoon, you might prefer a private experience with your partner. However sometimes it might as well be fun to meet other travels. <strong>Group tours are more economical</strong>, as you share your guide and ride with fellow travelers. <strong>Private tours</strong> can often be customized a little bit if you ask nicely, allowing you to have a personalized experience.</p>

        <p>Rather venture out together without an organized tour? Check our <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="/explore/romantic-activities-bali/">list of 50 favorite romantic activities</a> too.</p>

            <p class="mt-0 text-gray-800">
              Explore Bali from a river! A raft takes you down Ayung River, through rice fields and jungle in some of the greenest parts of Bali. You'll pass waterfalls and have the opportunity to swim in crystal clear waters. These are places that are not reachable any other way than by raft!
            </p>
            <p class="mt-0 text-gray-800">
              While there are definitely a few rougher parts, this is a beginner-friendly raft experience. A guide will join you on your boat and life vests are provided. Hotel pickup can be arranged, and a buffet lunch on the river banks is included in the price.

              Explore the best of Nusa Penida Island by yacht. We can organize a private yacht just for the two of you, or have you share a yacht with a small group of up to ten other people (more affordable). Your yacht will depart from Sanur Harbour, and make stops at Manta Point (snorkel with manta rays!), the beautiful Crystal Bay and the secluded Gamat Bay before docking for an on-shore lunch at the Khamara Beach Club on Nusa Penida Island. In the afternoon, you can choose between a land tour by car on Nusa Penida island, exploring the spectacular Keling King beach, or sailing to some more snorkeling spots on the north side of Nusa Penida.

              Hi! We have put together this guide with a lot of care, based
              on our own experiences. As a couple, we have lived in Bali for
              the past 5 years, and we fell in love with the island. We have
              visited every corner of Bali, especially the romantic places
              ;-). While our articles do contain affiliate links, you can
              trust us to recommend only the experiences that we love. >
