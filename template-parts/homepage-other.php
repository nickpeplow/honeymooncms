          Indonesia beyond Bali
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          As we lived in Bali for many years, we had the opportunity to explore
          many corners of Indonesia. Olivia is originally from
          <strong>North Sumatra</strong>, a region famous for orangutans and one
          the largest volcanic lake in the world. Unfortunately, this region is
          a bit far from Bali (it requires 2 flights to get there!). However,
          there are many great regions closer to Bali that we love to recommend
          for a honeymoon in Indonesia.

          Be aware that Bali is very luxurious and easy to travel compared to
          the rest of Indonesia. If you plan to enjoy fine dining and splurge on
          5-star

          But if you are an adventurous couple… Indonesia is a beautiful large
          and diverse archipelago with over 17.000 islands. Some great
          destinations can be reached <strong>by ferry</strong> from Bali, while
          other destinations will require a <strong>domestic flight</strong> or
          even multiple flights. Below we list our favorite regions adventurous
          couples should consider when visiting Indonesia.

            Between Bali and Lombok you will find the three
            <strong>Nusa Islands</strong>, of which
            <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="#"
              >Nusa Penida</a
            >
            is the largest and we believe the most interesting. It offers iconic
            cliffs and beaches to explore. Nusa Lebongan and Nusa Ceningan
            island are getting more popular too, but are much smaller and don’t
            offer as stunning landscapes.

            Climb the <strong>Iljen and Bromo</strong> volcanoes in East Java.
            Reachable by short ferry from Gilimanuk in west Bali, or by direct
            plane from Bali to Surabaya.
          </li>
          <li class="pb-3">
            Explore the cultural heart of Java and visit the world’s largest
            temple Borobodur in <strong>Yogjakarta</strong>. Direct flights from
            Bali to Yogyakarta are available.

            Say hi to komodo dragons and dive with manta rays around
            <strong>Flores and the Komodo Islands</strong>. Take a direct flight
            to Labuan Bajo on Flores Island. From there you can board a
            multi-day boat trip to the Komodo Islands, or stay overnight and
            join any of the day trips to Komodo.

            See orang-utans in Bukit Lawang and discover Lake Toba, the largest
            volcanic lake in the world, in <strong>North Sumatra</strong>. We
            love this region (Olivia grew up here!). Not many direct flights
            from Bali to Medan are available, most options will require a
            transit in Jakarta. Medan is easy to reach with direct flights from
            Singapore and Kuala Lumpur too.

          <li class="pb-3">
            Explore the underwater world in the world-famous
            <strong>Raja Ampat</strong> in West Papua. This is said to be one of
            the world’s best dive sights - but it is really hard to get here! It
            will involve multiple flights and a ferry.
          </li>
          <li class="pb-3">
            Go off the beaten path and discover the beauty of
            <strong>Sumba Island</strong> - great for surf and pristine beaches.
            Direct flights to Tambolaka are available. Oddly, the world’s most
            luxurious resort, the Nihi Sumba, can be found on this island.

            Indonesia’s capital <strong>Jakarta</strong> is not known as a
            honeymoon destination. However, many people enter the country here,
            and there is a lot of history to see, food to enjoy and some luxury
            hotels to stay at. In addition, it could be a starting point for
            discovering Java island by train.
          </li>
          <li class="pb-3">
            <strong>Bandung</strong> is one of the nicer cities in Indonesia. It
            is very green, nestled against the West Java mountains. Worth
            visiting if you plan to travel overland from Java to Bali.
          </li>
          <li class="pb-3">
            The island of <strong>Wakatobi</strong> is a luxurious dive
            destination near Sulawesi. Guests who stay at the Wakatobi Resort
            can hop on the complimentary private jet(!) from Bali to fly to the
            island.
