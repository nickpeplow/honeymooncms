            The island of Bali is larger than most people expect, and has many

            <strong>combine a few regions</strong> during their honeymoon in
            Bali to get a full taste of what the island has to offer. Check out

            <strong>North Bali</strong> is a different world, away from the
            crowds: spectacular nature with dense jungle, 100-meter high
            waterfalls, volcanoes, crater lakes, calm beaches, hot springs and
            more. North Bali is where you will still find very traditional
            Balinese life. Our articles on
