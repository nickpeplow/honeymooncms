          Honeymoon Hotels and Resorts
        </h2>
        <p>
          The options for Bali honeymoon hotels are endless. Bali offers
          <strong>spectacular luxury at reasonable cost</strong>, especially
          compared to locations in the Western hemisphere. A 5-star hotel
          experience in Bali might cost the same as a 3-star hotel in Australia,
          Europe, or North America. Add the famous
          <strong>Balinese hospitality</strong>, and you can be sure to
          celebrate your honeymoon in comfort and style!
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Not all regions in Bali offer the same amount of luxury honeymoon
          hotel options - but there are great places to stay all over the island
          for any budget.
          <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="#">Uluwatu</a>
          and
          <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="#">Seminyak</a>
          are your best bets for luxury beachfront resorts, while the jungle
          town of
          <a class="text-tertiary underline font-bold" href="#">Ubud</a>
          is well known for it’s luxury accomodation overlooking valleys, rivers
          and ricefields.

          Our favorite option in Ubud. The Viceroy Bali targets couples and
          honeymooners with its upmarket, quiet, and private environment. The
          hotel's 40 villas overlook the Petanu River Valley and Mount Batur.
          Their marble bathrooms with sunken or soaking bathtubs are traditional
          and magnificent. It also has an outdoor café, a beautiful pool with a
          swim-up bar, a hillside spa, and a modern gym for those who want to
          continue their exercise routines in Bali.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          One additional reason to stay at the Viceroy: the location is serene
          with views over the jungle, but it is still very close to Ubud town.
          It will only take around 5-10 minutes by car to get to Ubud's main
          street, and a shuttle is available.

          Located on Seminyak beach and embraced by fifteen acres of lush
          gardens, The Oberoi is a luxury sanctuary in the middle of trendy
          Seminyak. The hotel exudes old-world Balinese style - thatched roofs,
          manicured tropical gardens with tall palm trees, and a fantastic
          location right by the beach. Enjoy the beautiful stretch of
          yellow-sand Seminyak beach and majestic sunset views with all sorts of
          magical colors from this luxury lodge.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Kura Kura restaurant you can enjoy Indonesian and European
          cuisine overlooking the ocean. While the Oberoi only has one
          restaurant, less than some of the other high end resorts, in Seminyak
          there are always plenty of (fine) dining options to choose from. The
          staff at Oberoi is extraordinarily friendly with genuine attention to
          your every need and always ready to go out of their way to make sure
          guests have an amazing holiday.
