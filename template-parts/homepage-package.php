          The Cost of a Bali Honeymoon
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          A Bali honeymoon can be expensive, especially when frequenting fine
          dining restaurants, fancy clubs and the best honeymoon suites.
          However, a Bali honeymoon is possible on almost any budget. No matter
          what level of luxury you and your partner prefer, you will be
          guaranteed to get <strong>amazing value for money</strong> in Bali. We
          said it before, but luxurious hotels and restaurants cost a fraction
          of what they cost in most other countries in the world.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          A <strong>reasonable budget</strong> without going overboard would be
          around 300USD per night, including food, accomodation and activities.
          This does require some conscious choices. If you would like to
          experience the best hotels in Bali, you will likely spend more than
          that on just accomodation. Some hotels, like the Bulgari or Four
          Seasons, offer their best honeymoon suites at rates well beyond
          1000USD per night. Beach Clubs and nightlife can get expensive too -
          often expecting a minimum spend for their best tables or sunbeds.
          Donâ€™t let that scare you however: you can really have a honeymoon in
          Bali on any budget. There are couples who manage to get by with less
          than 100USD per night!
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">Some tips to keep the budget within reason:</p>
        <ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
          <li class="pb-3">
            Ubud, Seminyak, Uluwatu and Canggu are known to be more expensive
            regions, while Nusa Penida, Amed and Lovina are known to be
            <strong>cheaper regions</strong>. Combining a luxurious location
            with a more affordable region might be an option.
          </li>
          <li class="pb-3">
            Fine dining with your partner is amazing. But Bali has amazing
            <strong>street food</strong> at extremely low prices. Give it a try!
          </li>
          <li class="pb-3">
            Especially in Canggu and Seminyak: the beachfront hotels are
            expensive. Look a little further <strong>inland</strong>. You can
            still get the beach experience by visiting a beach club for a day!
